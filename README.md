# python-api-challenge

Hello

This repository is for the module 6 python api challenge.

It has two folders:
- WeatherPy - which contains my Jupyter Notebook and outputs for that section
- VacationPy - which contains my Jupyter Notebook for that section.

In the main section of the repository you will see a .gitignore file which I have used so I don't expose my api keys.

Thanks
Kim
